// the same convention vfx/ uses. This wrapper exists so `npm run dist` can gate
// on them the way it already gates on check:vfx: a building document is a spec
// that has to regenerate its geometry deterministically, and the two properties
// that guarantee that - the offset behaviour roof generation depends on, and the
// identity-hashed seeding that stops an edit reshuffling the whole facade - are
// both invisible until someone notices a building looks wrong.
//
// Discovered rather than listed, so a new test file is picked up by existing
// without anyone having to remember this file exists.
