// How many triangles a slot model is allowed, given how many times it is drawn.
//
// THE COST OF A SLOT MODEL IS NOT ITS OWN SIZE. A slot is instanced, so binding
// one model costs `triangles x instances`, and the second number is decided by
// the grammar rather than by whoever picked the model. A 12,000-triangle fin is
// a perfectly ordinary generated mesh; the same fin on a 42-storey tower is
// 1,808 instances and 21.7 MILLION triangles, and instancing does not help with
// that at all - it saves draw calls, and this is not a draw-call problem. The
// viewport crawled and nothing anywhere said why.
//
// So the budget is on the TOTAL, and the per-model target falls out of it. A
// cottage with forty windows leaves a 30,000-triangle window untouched; a tower
// with eighteen hundred fins gets them at 600 triangles each, which on a blade
// that is two metres of a hundred-and-fifty-metre building is a difference
// nobody can see. Measured on the fin that prompted this: 12,000 -> 600 costs
// 1% geometric error and 8 ms.
//
// THE PREVIEW AND THE EXPORTER SHARE IT, because they share this loader, and
// because a building that is one thing on screen and another in the file is the
// failure this whole module set is arranged to avoid.
