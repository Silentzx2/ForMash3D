// Turning a building into something that can leave the app.
//
// THREE THINGS HAVE TO CHANGE between what the preview draws and what an
// exporter can carry, and each of them is invisible until it bites:
//
//  1. INSTANCES MUST BE BAKED. The preview draws every opening as one
//     InstancedMesh per (type, material) - thousands of windows for one draw
//     call. three's GLTFExporter writes an InstancedMesh's BASE mesh once and
//     drops the instance transforms, so an exported tower would arrive with a
//     single window at the origin. Every instance is therefore flattened into
//     real geometry here.
//
//  2. TEXTURE REPEAT MUST BE BAKED INTO THE UVs. Walls are UV-mapped in metres
//     and tiled with texture.repeat = 1/tileMetres - see textures.js. A glTF
//     carries repeat only through KHR_texture_transform, which plenty of
//     importers ignore, and when it is ignored the building arrives with one
//     enormous brick stretched over each wall. Dividing the UVs instead needs no
//     extension and cannot be misread.
//
//  3. LODs ARE REGENERATED, NOT DECIMATED. This is the same argument
//     python-server/app/services/treegen/lod.py makes for trees, and it is
//     stronger for buildings: a general simplifier judges triangles, and the
//     cheapest triangles to delete are the window reveals and the cornice -
//     exactly the silhouette that says "building". Asking the GRAMMAR for less
//     detail instead gives wider bays, no trim and eventually a plain massing
//     block, each of which is still a correct building.

 * usable LOD chain. Shrinking the MODEL cannot cover for it either: a simplifier
 * has a topology floor (the fin that prompted this will not go below 392
 * triangles however little it is offered), so two levels that both ask for less
 * than that floor produce identical geometry.
 *
 * WITHIN EACH (type, floor), IN (face, bay) ORDER, which is the ring of posts
 * round one storey read in order. Keeping every Nth of that is spatially even -
 * it reads as coarser ribbing rather than as a gap - and it is deterministic, so
 * the same posts survive every recompile and a level does not shimmer against
 * the one above it. The first stride is nearly free: the post at the end of one
 * edge stands on the same corner as the post at the start of the next, so
 * keeping every second one mostly removes coincident pairs.
 *
 * OPENINGS ARE NOT THINNED by default, and should not be: a missing window is a
 * hole in a facade, and bayScale already reduces windows correctly.
