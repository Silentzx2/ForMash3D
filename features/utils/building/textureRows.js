// The rows BuildingTextures draws, for each of the two scopes.
//
// SEPARATE FROM THE COMPONENT because the fallback wording is the part that
// makes the three-level chain understandable, and it is easier to keep honest in
// one small function than spread through JSX. A row that says "palette colour
// only" and a row that says "same as the building" look identical in the UI and
// mean completely different things.
//
// THE CHAIN, most specific first:
//
//   <facade>.wall.north   this facade's storeys, north side only
//   <facade>.wall         this facade's storeys, every side
//   tex_wall              the whole building
//   the palette colour    no texture at all
//
// A Trim node has the same shape with one fewer rung: <trim>.trim, then tex_trim,
// then the colour. Trims accumulate, so each run needs its own or a plinth and a
// cornice could never differ.
//
// building/ir.js resolveMaterialIndex is what actually applies it; this file
// only has to describe it truthfully.
