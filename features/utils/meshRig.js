// Rig preservation for the Mesh Editor.
//
// The editor works on one flattened, world-space BufferGeometry — that is what
// makes its tools simple. A rigged mesh therefore has to be taken apart on load
// and put back together on save:
//
//   * the per-vertex skin data (skinIndex/skinWeight) rides along as ordinary
//     geometry attributes, so anything that only moves vertices — sculpting,
//     painting, projection, the pivot fix — keeps it valid for free;
//   * the skeleton itself (bones + inverse bind matrices) is captured here at
//     load time and kept aside, because it is a scene graph, not vertex data,
//     and nothing in the editing pipeline can carry it.
//
// On export the two are recombined into a SkinnedMesh.
//
// ── Why the bind matrix becomes identity ────────────────────────────────────
// loadEditableGeometryFromObject bakes each vertex through `child.matrixWorld`,
// so the editable geometry holds rest-pose *world* positions rather than bind
// space. Writing p' = bindMatrix·p, three's skinning of the original mesh
// reduces at rest to Σ(boneᵢ.matrixWorld · boneInverseᵢ · p' · wᵢ) = p'. Feeding
// the already-baked p' back in with bindMatrix = I therefore reproduces exactly
// the same rest pose — which is why the node transform is pinned to identity
// too. Keeping the original bind matrix instead would apply it twice and deform
// the mesh.

// different units, and the transfer corrects for that by scaling the source
// surface onto this mesh — so the bones whose weights that surface carries have
// to make the identical move, or the mesh is bound to a skeleton half its size
// sitting inside it.
//
// Only positions change. A UNIFORM scale leaves every rotation alone, so the
// bones keep their orientation, and rotation and scale tracks keep meaning what
// they meant. What does not come free is a clip's own TRANSLATION tracks (root

// rig's own animation objects and a second run must start from them unmodified.

//     rig stands on. Scaling it alone would key the rig back to where the source
//     stood, undoing the move the rest of this function just made, so it takes
//     the FULL transform (through its parent's frame, which itself did not move).
