// The six slot colours, editable.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. Every surface the generator draws takes its colour from one
// of six palette slots, and until now the only way to set them was to apply a
// style pack - so "the timbers are the wrong brown" had no answer short of
// editing a JSON file on disk and restarting the server. It was reported exactly
// that way, about the Frame node, which draws in the trim slot.
//
// IT EDITS THE DOCUMENT, NOT THE PACK. A pack is shared by every building that
// uses it; this is one building's paint. `building.style` is already the
// per-document snapshot a pack leaves behind, so a colour set here survives a
// save, travels in a `.3dgp` export, and is overwritten the next time a style is
// applied - which is the right behaviour, because applying a style is a
// deliberate "make it look like this".
//
// A NATIVE COLOUR INPUT, not a picker of our own. It is one control, the OS
// gives it a real eyedropper and recent-colours, and a hand-rolled HSV square
// would be three hundred lines to be worse at it.
