// Turning the IR's material slots into three.js textures.
//
// WHY THIS IS NOT IN mesh.js. Meshing is synchronous and pure: an IR goes in, a
// BufferGeometry comes out, and a plain node test can run it. Loading a texture
// is neither - it is a fetch, then a decode, then a GPU upload, and it can fail
// halfway. Keeping the two apart is what lets the geometry tests stay headless.
//
// TILING IS IN METRES, WHICH IS THE WHOLE POINT. mesh.js UV-maps walls as
// (run, height) in metres and caps as plan metres - see its header - so a
// texture's repeat is simply 1/tileMetres and a brick wall is the same size on a
// cottage and on a tower. The obvious alternative, normalising UVs per face,
// makes every wall show exactly one tile and a forty-storey tower wear one
// enormous brick.
