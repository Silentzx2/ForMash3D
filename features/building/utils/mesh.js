// BuildingIR -> three.js geometry.
//
// This is the boundary the pure contract in building/ stops at. Everything above
// it is plain arithmetic over JSON; everything here knows about BufferGeometry,
// vertex winding and UV layout. Keeping the split at a serialisable IR is what
// lets the same compiler run in the tab, on the server and in a plain node test.
//
// THE AXIS SWAP HAPPENS HERE, ONCE.
//
//   BuildingIR is Z-UP:  X east, Y north, Z up. A footprint is drawn in plan and
//                        the building rises in Z, which is how the drawing reads
//                        and how every calculation in mass.js and roof.js is
//                        written.
//   three.js is Y-UP.
//
//   ir(x, y, z)  ->  three(x, z, -y)
//
// That mapping is a right-handed basis change with a positive determinant, so it
// PRESERVES ORIENTATION: a counter-clockwise ring in plan stays counter-
// clockwise seen from above, and the winding conventions poly.js guarantees
// (outer CCW, holes CW) still produce outward-facing normals with no per-face
// correction. Flipping a single axis instead - the obvious "just swap Y and Z" -
// mirrors the building and turns every face inside out, which shows up as a
// model that looks right until it is lit.
//
// EVERY LEVEL IS A CLOSED PRISM. Walls plus a cap at the bottom and the top,
// even where two levels touch and the caps between them are never seen. The
// alternative - capping only exposed surfaces - needs to know which parts of a
// level's top are covered by the level above, which for a setback or battered
// mass is a polygon difference per storey. The hidden faces cost triangles and
// nothing else: they are interior, they are back-facing, and the optimiser in
// the export path removes them properly (services/hidden_faces.py already does
// exactly this job). Correct and simple now, cheap to improve later.

 * One annular band of a roof.

 * proximity rather than by identity: the band comes back from Clipper as fresh
 * coordinates, quantised to its integer lattice, so the vertices are equal in
 * value but never the same objects.
 *
 * UV-MAPPED IN THE SLOPE'S OWN PLANE, not from above. The plan x/y used to be
 * handed straight out as the uv, which is a top-down projection, and it is wrong
 * in two ways that a flat roof hides. It bakes the PLAN's axes into the texture,
 * so shingle courses run along the eave on a roof whose eave happens to lie
 * along x and straight DOWN the slope on one that runs along y - a cross-gable
 * shows both at once, which is how it was found. And it foreshortens by
 * cos(pitch), so a 50 degrees slope stretches its tiles by half again.
 *
 * The frame is built from the triangle's own normal: `u` along the horizontal
 * in-plane direction, which is the eave, and `v` up the true slope. Both are
 * world distances in metres, so a roof texture stays the size it is set to and
 * the mapping is isometric. It is derived per triangle but depends only on the
 * plane, so every triangle of one slope agrees and the seam falls on the ridge
 * where roofing has one anyway. A FLAT face has no in-plane horizontal to pick,
 * and there the plan projection is the right answer - a deck is seen from above -

 * The trim, swept along its runs.

 * THE MITRE IS THE WHOLE JOB. Sweeping a section along a polyline is easy; the

 * station the section is placed along the BISECTOR of the two adjoining edges
 * and scaled by 1/cos(half the turn), which is exactly the amount that makes the
 * two straight runs meet in a clean mitre instead of leaving a notch on the
 * outside and a fold on the inside. Doing it per face - a separate moulding on
 * each wall - cannot produce that joint at all, which is why building/trim.js
 * emits polylines and not faces.
 *
 * The miter scale is CLAMPED. A near-reversing corner (a very thin spur in the
 * plan) sends 1/cos to infinity and would fire a spike of trim off into space;
 * clamping trades a slightly open mitre on a pathological corner for geometry
 * that stays inside the building.
 *
 * Paths arrive ALREADY DEFORMED - the compiler warps them when it builds the IR -
 * so nothing here knows about deformation, and the bisectors are computed on the
 * bent building, which is what makes a cornice follow a twisted wall.
