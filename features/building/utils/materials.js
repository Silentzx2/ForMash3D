// WHY A FILE AND NOT THREE JSX LINES IN THE VIEWPORT. Before per-facade
// overrides a building had exactly three surfaces - walls, roof, trim - and
// declaring their materials inline was the clearest thing. It is not clear any
// more: a facade can override the wall on the storeys it claims, and again on
// one side of them, so the number of wall materials is a property of the
// document rather than of the code. Building them from the IR's material table
// puts the count where it belongs, and gives the geometry's draw GROUPS an array
// to index into.
//
// SURFACE FINISH IS PER SLOT, not per entry. An override changes what a surface
// is made of, not whether it is a wall - a brick and a stone ground floor are
// both matte masonry, and asking an author to set roughness per override would
// be a material editor, which this is not.
