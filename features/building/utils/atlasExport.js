// Merging an exported building into one mesh with one texture.
//
// ---- Almost none of this is new ----------------------------------------------
//
// The layout and the bake already exist, written for the Mesh Assembly feature:
// `assemblyAtlas.js` packs islands by their UV bounding box and
// `assemblyAtlasBake.js` transfers each one into its new home on the GPU. This
// file is the adapter, and it exists because a building breaks three
// assumptions those two make.
//
// ---- 1. A building is UV-mapped in METRES -------------------------------------
//
// An assembly piece arrives with a 0..1 unwrap made for its own texture. A
// building's walls, roof and trim do not have one at all: they are mapped in
// metres and tiled, so a tower wall runs to uv 153.6 and a cottage's to 26.7.
// Only the openings are 0..1.
//
// The reflex is to unwrap the merged mesh through Auto UV and bake onto that by
// ray casting. It is the wrong tool twice over: it invents seams across a
// perfectly good parameterisation, it resamples through space (thin trim
// misprojects), and it makes a page that advertises "no service to start"
// depend on the Python service.
//
// It is also unnecessary, because the packer never assumed 0..1. It sizes an
// island as `uvBounds x textureSize`, so feeding it metre UVs with textureSize
// expressed in PIXELS PER METRE gives exactly the right texel footprint - and
// atlas area then comes out proportional to real surface area, which is the
// texel density anyone would have asked for. One expression covers both cases,
// with no branch on the slot type:
//
//     textureSize = imagePixels * map.repeat.x
//
// because `repeat` is 1/tileMetres on a tiled slot and 1 on a cell slot. See
// textures.js, which sets both. The packer's own global rescale then finds the
// density that fits: a 153 m wall in a 2048 atlas is 13 px/m, and that is the
// right answer rather than a failure.
//
// ---- 2. The mesher emits NON-INDEXED geometry ---------------------------------
//
// An island is a connected component over the index buffer, so without a weld
// every triangle is its own island: a forty-storey tower would hand the packer
// four hundred thousand of them and fill the atlas with confetti. Welding by
// position AND uv is what recovers the real components - a wall strip comes back
// as one island, which is what it is.
//
// ---- 3. A window has holes in it ----------------------------------------------
//
// The holes are kept, and they do NOT cost a second material. Cut-outs used to
// be split into an alpha-tested atlas of their own, on the reasoning that
// sharing one with the walls would break depth sorting. That reasoning was
// wrong: it applies to BLENDING, and a cut-out is not blended. With
// `alphaTest` and `transparent: false` - glTF's MASK mode - the merged material
// sorts exactly like an opaque one, writes depth, and needs no ordering. So
// X materials means X, and if anything in the building punches holes then all X
// are masked.
//
// The shared bake stores COVERAGE in alpha (for the gutter fill), so the real
// alpha is recovered by `preserveAlpha`: a second greyscale pass through the
// same pipeline, composited back into the map's alpha channel.
