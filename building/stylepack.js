// Style packs: the same graph, a different building.
//
// THE SPLIT THIS FILE EXISTS TO ENFORCE. The node graph describes STRUCTURE - a
// mass, storeys, bays, slots tagged window/door/pillar - and knows nothing about
// Rome or Tenochtitlan. A style pack supplies the VOCABULARY that turns that
// structure into a particular kind of building. Keeping them apart is what lets
// one graph serve ten style families instead of fragmenting into ten graphs.
//
// THE THING MOST PACK FORMATS GET WRONG is treating style as ornament: a texture
// swap on top of a shape that never changes. It does not work, and the reason is
// visible in the plan for this feature - Egyptian walls BATTER inward, Mayan
// platforms STEP, Medieval upper floors JETTY out, Roman villas wrap a
// COURTYARD. Those are massing decisions. A pack that could only repaint would
// produce ten differently-coloured versions of the same box, which is precisely
// the failure this whole design is arranged to avoid.
//
// So a pack carries three things, and the first is the one that matters most:
//
//   graph       an ordered recipe of stages between the Footprint and the
//               Output - what mass profile, what facades, what roof.
//   palette     the colours the preview draws until real assets exist.
//   vocabulary  which asset fills each slot type. Phase 6 fills this in; the
//               format is validated here so there is somewhere for it to land.
//
// THE RECIPE IS RESTRICTED TO THE EXISTING CATALOG, and validateStylePack
// enforces it. That restriction is the whole falsification test: if Egyptian or
// Mayan cannot be written as data against the nodes that already exist, a pack
// for them will not validate, and that is a signal to fix the abstraction rather
// than to bolt on a style-specific node. A pack that needs new code is a bug in
// the vocabulary, not a feature of the style.
//
// A PACK IS NOT A LIVE BINDING. Applying one WRITES into the document - node
// props, modes, a palette snapshot - and then gets out of the way. The author
// can edit every value afterwards, and a building saved today still opens the
// same way after the shipped pack is revised, because nothing is resolved at
// compile time from a file on disk. `building.stylePackId` records where the
// settings came from; it is provenance, not a dependency.
