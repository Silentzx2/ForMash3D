// The building contract: everything about a procedural building that both the
// browser and the backend have to agree on.
//
// WHY THIS IS A ROOT DIRECTORY and not src/utils/building/. The server needs the
// document schema (to validate an imported .building.json and to mirror its
// digest into the Assets.metadata column), and it will need the catalog and the
// compiler to build an export bundle - and src/ IS NOT SHIPPED in a packaged
// build. Only dist/ is. So shared code cannot live under src/ without breaking
// the desktop app and the Docker image, which is why db/, mcp/ and vfx/ are laid
// out the same way.
//
// THREE BUILD REGISTRATIONS ARE MANDATORY for that to hold, and the repo has
// been bitten by forgetting them before - serverMode.js notes that user asset
// directories shipped missing twice. They are:
//
//   electron-builder.yml  files:            - building/**/*
//   Dockerfile                              COPY --chown=node:node building ./building
//   .dockerignore                           !building/
//
// The .dockerignore entry is needed TWICE OVER: the builder stage's `COPY . .`
// is filtered by that allowlist too, so without it the FRONTEND build also fails
// to resolve ../../building/*.js and the whole image build dies at vite.
//
// tools/check-packaged-modules.mjs walks the import graph from server.js and
// fails the build if any module reachable from it is missing from either
// allowlist, so once server.js imports this directory the rule is enforced
// mechanically rather than remembered.
//
// WHAT BELONGS HERE: pure, environment-neutral modules. No React, no three.js,
// no fs, no process. Everything in this directory has to run identically in a
// browser tab, in Node, and inside a test harness - which is also what makes it
// all testable with plain `node building/*.test.mjs`.
//
// The one external dependency is clipper-lib, imported only by clip.js. It is a
// 200KB UMD file with no Node builtins, so it is as environment-neutral as the
// rest of this directory; see clip.js for why polygon offsetting is not
// something we hand-roll.
//
// WHAT DOES NOT BELONG HERE: the meshing itself and anything that touches the
// GPU. Turning a BuildingIR into BufferGeometry, instancing the slots, building
// materials and the R3F components all live in src/utils/building/ and
// src/components/building/, because only the preview runs them - an exporter
// consumes the IR instead.
//
// DETERMINISM IS ENFORCED. eslint.config.js bans Math.random under building/**.
// A stored building is a small spec that must regenerate its geometry
// bit-for-bit; see building/random.js for why a slot's seed is a hash of its
// identity rather than a position in a stream.
