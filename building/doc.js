// The building document: what a .building.json file contains, and the only
// definition of its shape. Pure functions over plain JSON - no React, no
// three.js, no I/O - the same division of labour vfx/doc.js has with VFX graphs
// and src/utils/assemblyHelpers.js has with MeshAssemblies.
//
// The server stores this file verbatim under data/assets/buildings/ and mirrors
// a small digest of it into the Assets.metadata column. It is a FILE and not a
// metadata blob for a reason worth knowing before anyone tries to move it:
// storage.js MERGES metadata rather than replacing it (replaceAssetFileById), so
// a document held there could never lose a key. Delete a node, save, reload, and
// the node would come back. A file is replaced whole.
//
// FOUR INVARIANTS. Each has a plausible-looking alternative that breaks
// something specific. They are the same four vfx/doc.js states, for the same
// reasons, and the two files should be changed together if any of them ever
// stops being true.
//
//  1. `edges` IS AUTHORITATIVE FOR WIRING. A node input that is driven by
//     another node also carries `linked: true` on its prop so the inspector can
//     label the row without scanning every edge per render, but that mirror is
//     DERIVED. normalizeBuildingDoc rebuilds it from edges every time, so the
//     two can never drift apart, and no other code may write it directly.
//
//  2. `layout` IS NEVER READ BY THE COMPILER. Node positions, collapsed flags,
//     pane widths - all cosmetic. buildingSignature() omits them, which is what
//     makes the signature usable as a recompile trigger: dragging a node around
//     must not rebuild the building. A building is more expensive to rebuild
//     than a particle system, so this matters more here than it does in VFX.
//
//  3. ASSET REFERENCES ARE SLOT KEYS, RESOLVED THROUGH ONE TABLE. A node says
//     'tex_facade', and doc.references maps that to an asset. This gives the
//     bundle builder one place to walk, project import one place to remap, and
//     turns a deleted texture into a dangling KEY - reportable and repairable in
//     the editor - rather than a dangling asset id nobody can trace.
//
//  4. EVERY REFERENCE IS THE STRING 'asset:<id>'. Not a bare number.
//     storage.js's collectAssetIdsFromValue and remapReferencesDeep both match
//     /^asset:(\d+)$/ against strings, so this shape makes a .3dgp project
//     export carry a building's textures and project import renumber them with
//     ZERO changes to either walker. Tree presets store bare numbers and
//     therefore ship broken across installations - the reference file is
//     src/utils/treeGen.js, and it is the mistake this invariant exists to avoid
//     repeating.
//
// WHERE THE FOOTPRINT LIVES. In a Footprint node's props, not at the top level.
// That looked like an odd choice at first - the footprint feels like a property
// of the building - but putting it in the graph is what allows more than one
// (a main block plus a wing), lets it be the output of a node rather than always
// hand-drawn, and means undo/redo, copy/paste and the inspector all work on it
// with no special cases. The plan editor edits whichever Footprint node is
// selected.
